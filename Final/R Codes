## Introduction/Background:

The problem under consideration is to be able to accurately predict the sales price  of the houses in the Ames housing dataset. This is an assignment problem and does not have an immediate real life implication to the home buyers in Ames; however, the problem is interesting in a sense that it provides a good medium to practice data and modelling skills acquired overtime in the MSPA program. This dataset acts as an extended version of the popular Boston housing dataset, and provides an opportunity to wrangle, analyze, model, and predict the price of the houses. This problem and the Kaggle delivery/evaluation format allows us to practice and hone our modelling skills so that, one day, we will be able to feature engineer and predict the real prices of the houses with higher accuracy for personal and professional use.

Housing data is significant for many personal as well and professional buyers, government entities, real estate agencies and other companies. Some interesting applications of the housing prices include valuation, risk measurement and management, credit applications, taxation, collateral assessment and financing, among others. Therefore, it is imperative for the model output to be as close to the actual as possible.

The dataset for this exercise was provided by our professor via Kaggle competition link. However, the original data is compiled and produced by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.

## Data Preparation:

This report explains the different models for the home sale price of a defined population of houses using the housing data of Ames population from 2,919 observations. There were a total of 79 variables – including continuous, nominal, ordinal, and discrete – involved in this study.

I have made various transformations to enhance the predicted sale prices. For example, for the purpose of this study I have limited the population to small family houses -- eliminating apartment complex, warehouses, and condominiums data. There are many factors affecting the sale price of the houses in this study as indicated by the list of variables. However, I will be taking multiple approaches to select the appropriate variables, and test to see which combination of variables perform better and which ones don’t. I will be building multiple models with multiple selection of variables to test the fit and predict the sale price of the houses.  I used the goodness of fit (GOF), compared different models and tested the fit. In conclusion, based on my analysis, I was able to deduce a model that worked the best and other models that didn’t work as great for our response variable (y).

For the seven linear models, I used the automated variable selection techniques  such as: forward, stepwise, and backward selection techniques, among other techniques, to test and compare the models’ attributes and performance based on different sets of variables. After selecting the variables, I computed the R-square, AIC, BIC, MSE, and MAE to determine which of the models fit. Finally, I assigned a grading matrix to grade the predictive accuracy of the models and determine material significance.
