## Background and Introduction:

The problem under consideration is to be able to accurately predict the precipitation for the  time range between August 2014 and July 2016. This is an assignment problem and does not have an immediate real life implication to the respective government authority; however, the problem is interesting in a sense that it provides the beginners (such as me and other students in this class) an opportunity to wrangle, analyze, model, and predict the precipitation and compare it against the real life data of precipitation. This problem and the Kaggle delivery/evaluation format allows us to practice and hone our modelling skills so that, one day, we will be able to predict the real precipitation with higher accuracy and make a significant impact to the world.

Precipitation data is used in many different industries for a wide varieties of applications. Some interesting applications of the precipitation data are laid out by NASA as, “precipitation data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission reveals new information on hurricane eyewalls and intensity, measures hazard- triggering rainfall events, provides input into climate and land surface models, and offers new insights into agricultural productivity and world health.” In addition to these applications, precipitation data are used by the population to plan their day, vacations, and other activities that is likely to be affected by the chances of rain. An accurate modelling of precipitation data impacts the general population, scientific community, and other entities. Therefore, it is imperative for the model output to be as close to the actual as possible.

The dataset for this exercise was provided by our professor via Kaggle competition post. However, the original data is collected and produced by Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). GHCN is a database that collects the daily temperature, precipitation, and snow records of the global land areas. GHCN data is a composite of the data formed by merging and validating data from different sources. There are over 40 variables in the GHCN-daily data set that replaced the older NCDC maintained data sets. GHCN is the world’s largest collection of daily climatological data with over 1.4 billion data values.

However, the dataset we received for this modelling exercise was a dataset with only two columns – Date and Precipitation. The task in hand was to use the historical precipitation data from September 1946 to July 2014, and forecast the precipitation from August 2014 to July  2016.

## Types of Model:

In order to forecast the precipitation from August 2014 to July 2016, we need to build models based on the historical precipitation data, as that is the only variable we have available.  However, since the dataset extends from 1946, we can identify significant trends and seasons in the pattern of precipitation data. Based on these cues, I developed the following different models:
 

Model 1: Multiple regression model with monthly and yearly data (Highest Performing Model)

Staying within the limitations and the environment presented in above mentioned data description and constraints, I developed a linear model to forecast the precipitation based on the month and year data. The reason I picked linear model with month and year data is because we had only two columns and rich historical time frame. Linear model with PRCP, Month, and Year variables allowed me to forecast the precipitation with those limited variables.

I started by importing the original data set in R Studio console, and then parsing the data into ‘Month’ and ‘Year’ format. Upon parsing the data, I developed a linear model with Precipitation data and year + month data (PRCP ~ Year + Month). The linear model was then fitted to a plot to visualize and was assigned a prediction interval to understand the fluctuation in prediction. A new data frame was then built to fit the precipitation data for the time interval between August 2014 and July 2016. Upon building the data frame a forecast model was assigned to the data frame by using the linear model built above. ‘Forecast’ package in R was used to perform the forecast. The model resulted in the following output:
